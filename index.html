        <h3 class="heading">What are Metaverse and Digital marketing?</h3>
        <p>Briefly, the metaverse is a virtual world that can give people a sense of immersion via high technology such as virtual reality and augmented reality. Digital marketing refers to using online platforms to boost sales, increase brand equity, and so on. It includes Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM), Social Media, Email etc.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Two tailwinds for Metaverse Digital Marketing</h3>
        <p>There were two factors that boosted the development of metaverse digital marketing, and COVID-19 was one of them. The pandemic caused every country to begin blocking its national boundaries, and a series of measures were implemented to prevent the spread of cases,  including commercial trading restrictions and stay-at-home orders. Such restrictions have significantly affected people's lifestyles and consumption habits and have led to an increase in screen time, which has considerably amplified the influence of digital marketing. Based on the data from Statista, global retail e-commerce sales have risen to approximately US$4.9 trillion in 2021.</p>
        <p>Another factor is the rapidly growing information technology nowadays, the soaring computing power and web3 enabling the realisation of the metaverse. The 5G technology and other network infrastructures (such as the installation of numerous base stations) facilitate digital marketing tremendously. With the widespread availability of mobile devices, companies are able to reach customers in more ways with various channels.</p>

        <p>There are many forward-looking companies that have started their own metaverse digital marketing, and Gucci is a good case. Gucci has partnered with 10KFT to mint their own NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Their NTF project, Gucci Grail, includes a virtual floating "New Tokyo" world, and fashion accessories for purchases by profile picture NFT owners and a fictional character named Wagmi-San. Moreover, Gucci has recently partnered with animated toy startup Superplastic to launch a series of 'SuperGucci' NFTs, and those who already own Superplastic's first NFTs can purchase SuperGucci NFTs in advance. Besides, Gucci has also purchased and is currently developing a virtual real estate in The Sandbox. This series of metaverse projects by Gucci have boosted their brand equity and promoted their products through various digital platforms.</p>
