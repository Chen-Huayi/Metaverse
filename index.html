            <p>In 2021, Facebook officially changed its name to Meta, which makes the
                metaverse become one of the most popular buzzwords nowadays. What is
                the metaverse, and how will it revolutionise digital marketing? How do
                companies utilise the metaverse to get more benefits? This blog will briefly
                answer these questions for you.</p>

                <h3 class="heading">What are Metaverse and Digital marketing?</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>Briefly, the metaverse is a virtual world that can give people a sense
                    of immersion via high technology such as virtual reality and augmented
                    reality. Digital marketing refers to using online platforms to boost sales,
                    increase brand equity, and so on. It includes Search Engine Optimisation
                    (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM), Social Media, Email etc.</p>

                <br/>
                <p>There were two factors that boosted the development of metaverse
                    digital marketing, and COVID-19 was one of them. The pandemic caused
                    every country to begin blocking its national boundaries, and a series of
                    measures were implemented to prevent the spread of cases,  including
                    commercial trading restrictions and stay-at-home orders. Such restrictions
                    have significantly affected people's lifestyles and consumption habits and
                    have led to an increase in screen time, which has considerably amplified
                    the influence of digital marketing. Based on the data from
                    <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/">Statista</a>
                    , global retail e-commerce sales have risen to approximately US$4.9 trillion in 2021.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Another factor is the rapidly growing information technology nowadays,
                    the soaring computing power and web3 enabling the realisation of the
                    metaverse. The 5G technology and other network infrastructures (such
                    as the installation of numerous base stations) facilitate digital marketing
                    tremendously. With the widespread availability of mobile devices, companies
                    are able to reach customers in more ways with various channels. Moreover,
                    improvements in technology have enabled advanced VR and AR facilities,
                    the evolution of wearable devices making it easier for customers to get
                    an immersive feel - which is what the metaverse sought. </p>

                <h3 class="heading">How metaverse digital marketing works in real world?</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>Many forward-looking companies have started their metaverse digital marketing,
                    and <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/gucci-goes-deeper-into-the-metaverse-for-next-nft-project">Gucci</a>
                    is a good case. Gucci has partnered with 10KFT to mint their own NFT (non-fungible token)
                    on the Ethereum blockchain. Their NTF project, Gucci Grail,
                    includes a virtual floating "New Tokyo" world, fashion accessories for purchase
                    by profile picture NFT owners and a fictional character named Wagmi-San.
                    Besides, Gucci has recently partnered with animated toy start-up Superplastic
                    to launch a series of 'SuperGucci' NFTs, and those who already own Superplastic's
                    first NFTs can purchase SuperGucci NFTs in advance. Moreover, Gucci is currently
                    developing virtual real estate in The Sandbox. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Gucci's series of metaverse projects successfully matched their target
                    customers who could bring them high profits - the avant-garde fashion
                    trendsetters. The clothing industry was hit hard as the frequency of
                    people going out during the pandemic plummeted. However, the digital
                    campaign launched by Gucci successfully created a new sales area for
                    them and made up for part of the losses. More importantly, at the same
                    time, Gucci has maintained public exposure on social media (an important
                    part of digital marketing), and metaverse technology allowing customers
                    to still get the virtual reality experience of buying Gucci. Such a campaign
                    uplifts Gucci's brand positioning, increasing brand equity and laying the
                    root for future brand metaverse marketing battles.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Another good case in point is
                    <a href="https://www.beyondgames.biz/24084/ikea-takes-its-augmented-reality-app-to-the-next-level/">IKEA</a>
                    , which has a more practical application
                    of metaverse technology compared to Gucci. IKEA is committed to applying
                    AR and VR to real-life purchasing scenarios for its customers, and its
                    recently launched Kreativ Scene Scanner allows customers to remove
                    their real furniture from an AR replica of a room. Additionally, IKEA has
                    launched 50 3D showrooms that enable consumers to virtually read its
                    catalogue and try out featured products in their AR-simulated rooms.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    IKEA's metaverse digital marketing program starts from a customer's actual
                    usage scenario and hits the pain point of the purchase journey. When people
                    want to simulate the addition of a piece of furniture to their house, they will
                    choose to use the IKEA App. It is like the first website on the first page of a
                    SERP in the web2.0 era, and it's obvious that if customer search for furniture
                    in the future meta-universe, IKEA is definitely the one that stands out.

        <div id="Future-Application">
            <h2 class="heading">What does future metaverse digital marketing really look like?</h2>
            <br/>
            <p>There are two main approaches to metaverse digital marketing in the future,
                and one is to collaborate with other metaverse platforms, offering sponsorship
                and marketing in their metaverse. The other is for brands to build up a metaverse
                themselves and attract customers to their own metaverse and marketing.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The first approach that cooperates with other platforms does not require the
                brand to build its own metaverse, it just needs to provide sponsorship to the
                partner, so it does not require a large investment. Nowadays, there are two
                main types of metaverse platforms, games, and social media. For games, brands
                can place their products in the game, just like the ads that are placed in the film.
                Unlike existing digital marketing ads, digital marketing ads in the metaverse are
                immersive, tactile, and hard to escape. Similarly, in the metaverse of social media,
                sharing is immediate and immersive. Whereas existing social media can only carry
                information through text, images, and video, the metaverse encompasses much
                more sensory. Thinking outside the box, if a brand wants to sell an umbrella
                and needs to demonstrate its performance, then in the metaverse, they can
                turn the weather into any rain intensity and let customers experience it by
                themselves - which is quite challenging to accomplish in real life.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Another approach for brands is to build their own metaverse platform, which
                requires a huge investment of both time and money for companies. However,
                it can also bring them an entirely customised metaverse digital marketing campaign.
                Companies can customise a virtual metaverse factory based on their product
                line, where players collect raw materials and customise their own products in-game,
                and then players can decide whether they want to get it in the real world (and
                if so, companies will offer discounts accordingly). More so, companies can hold
                product creative design competitions in the metaverse, the popular designs will
                have a chance to be mass produced in the real world, and the designers will be
                rewarded. In addition, companies could also build a world of simple collecting
                games in the metaverse, where players would receive limited edition products
                after collecting specific products, as well as coupons for real-world products.
                In turn, purchasing real-world products would also enable players to get more
                collections in the game. In fact, such metaverse games could be organically
                integrated with the brand's existing consumer loyalty program to form an integrated
                marketing plan to enhance brand equity.

            <h2 class="heading">What are the challenges ahead for metaverse digital marketing?</h2>
            <br/>
            <p>Challenges always accompany the dawn of a new era. In addition to those technical
                challenges, metaverse digital marketing also suffers from the restrictions imposed by
                privacy policies. In order to achieve an immersive feel, metaverse needs to collect
                a lot of personal and private information, and the collection and storage of this
                information will be a big challenge. Moreover, the tokens used for trading in
                the metaverse will also need to be strictly regulated to avoid being used for illegal purposes.

            <p>The metaverse's have opened up a new era for the world, and it is important
                that we start laying out in advance to prepare for the future of digital marketing
                in the metaverse. From now on, combine your brand's digital marketing with
                AR and VR to seize this huge opportunity!</p>
